 * Bundle support [needs NTP, argh]
 * More/better regression tests
 * More/better example code
 * Unify URI handling [needs discussion]
 * GTK/Qt/etc. linking code [maybe belongs in another library]
 * Add source address to received messages
 * OSC pattern matching [still not sure about this one]
 * Rendevous/OpenWhatever (eg. howl) service discovery [low priority]
