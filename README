This is a lightweight, easy to use implementation of the OSC protocol (see
http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/ for details).

Examples of use can be found in src/testlo.c

NOTICE FOR MAC OS X:
Mac OS X defaults to ipv6 but most of the currently available OSC applications
like Pd and SuperCollider doesn't listen on ipv6 sockets. for now it's saver to
turn off ipv6 support in liblo (using ./configure --disable-ipv6).
