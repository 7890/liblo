<h1 id="release-0.28">2014-01-27: Release 0.28</h1>
<p>We are pleased to present stable release 0.28 of LibLo, the lightweight, easy to use implementation of the Open Sound Control protocol.</p>
<p>Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is designed for use over modern network transports.</p>
<p>Changes since the 0.28rc release candidate include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed build for Windows (MingW, MSVC) and Android platforms</li>
<li>Fixed an implicit cast issue in C++ bindings for lo::ServerThread</li>
<li>Documentation, small fixes</li>
<li>Added a function to get library version information (lo_version)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="release-candidate-0.28rc">2013-11-24: Release candidate 0.28rc</h1>
<p>This is a release candidate 0.28rc of LibLo, the lightweight, easy to use implementation of the Open Sound Control protocol.</p>
<p>Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is designed for use over modern network transports.</p>
<p>This is mainly a bugfix release due to some deal breakers that unfortunately made it through to the 0.27 release. Additionally, this is the first release to include a modern C++11 object-oriented wrapper for the LibLo API. Please test!</p>
<p>Important bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed checking of vararg markers on 64-bit systems</li>
<li>Fixed hang in TCP blocking test</li>
<li>Several potential bugs prevented through static analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add function lo_bundle_get_timestamp()</li>
<li>Add C++11 wrapper, `lo_cpp.h', and test program</li>
<li>Support for a few more build tools: clang/clang++, ccache</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="release-0.27">2013-05-22: Release 0.27</h1>
<p>We are pleased to present stable release 0.27 of LibLo, the lightweight, easy to use implementation of the Open Sound Control protocol.</p>
<p>Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is designed for use over modern network transports.</p>
<p>This is the first release in quite some time, and includes several major features and improvements since the 0.26 release, particularly related to bundles, multicast, and TCP support. Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for sending and receiving nested bundles, including ref-counted memory handling for bundled messages.</li>
<li>Support for multicast in oscdump and oscsend tools.</li>
<li>Callbacks for bundle handling.</li>
<li>Select desired network interface for multicast.</li>
<li>Fix blocking semantics of lo_server_wait() / lo_server_recv().</li>
<li>Make inclusion of threading-related code optional.</li>
<li>Basic compilation script for Android.</li>
<li>Allow to optionally disable server dispatch queueing at runtime. (In this case messages are dispatched immediately even if they are timestamped for later.)</li>
<li>Support bidirectional use of TCP ports using lo_send_from().</li>
<li>Add SLIP protocol support for packetization when sending and receiving with TCP.</li>
<li>Allow to enable the TCP_NODELAY flag on TCP sockets.</li>
<li>Support for specifying server parameters via URL string, and also support for URL strings in the oscsend and oscdump tools.</li>
<li>As a result of the above, support for TCP and Unix sockets in the oscsend and oscdump tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bug fixes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed timestamp serialization.</li>
<li>Fixed blob padding and char-type padding.</li>
<li>Close sockets properly under Windows.</li>
<li>Fix multicast under Windows.</li>
<li>Fix TCP reception blocking behaviour, such that a message can span multiple calls to recv().</li>
<li>Correct printing of blob bytes.</li>
<li>Only call getnameinfo() when requested.</li>

<h1 id="release-0.26">2009-03-07: Release 0.26</h1>
<p>We are pleased to present stable release 0.26 of LibLo, the lightweight, easy to use implementation of the Open Sound Control protocol.</p>
<p>Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is designed for use over modern network transports.</p>
<p>This release marks the first release of LibLo under the LGPL license version 2.1 or later, allowing the use of LibLo in non-GPL applications as long as it is dynamically linked such that the LibLo portion of the application can remain freely modifiable. We hope that this will allow compatibility with a wider variety of audio applications and encourage the use of open protocols even in commercial software. (This change was motivated by receiving a number of requests for special permission for the use of LibLo in non-GPL software.)</p>
<p>This release also introduces some new features, such as the ability to use custom transports, proper TCP multi-session support, access to bundle timestamp information, and wider C compiler compatibility.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change license to LGPL 2.1 or later.</li>
<li>Add return codes to all functions that may fail.</li>
<li>Fix memory leaks in lo_address_new_from_url(), dispatch_method(), lo_url_get_path()</li>
<li>Move lo_arg_size(), lo_get_path(), lo_arg_host/network_endian() back to lo_lowlevel.h.</li>
<li>Expose the lo_server_dispatch_data() function as public, making it possible to react to messages contained in an arbitrary block of memory. (i.e., allows use with custom transport protocols)</li>
<li>Get protocol by ID number.</li>
<li>Keep TCP sessions open, and automatically track multiple open sessions in a data structure.</li>
<li>Allow access to bundle timestamp information.</li>
<li>Fix bug in lo_timetag_diff().</li>
<li>Change the value of LO_TT_IMMEDIATE to correspond with the OSC specification.</li>
<li>Enable SO_REUSEPORT when initializing a multicast server.</li>
<li>Update the &quot;soname&quot; describing API/ABI compatibility.</li>
<li>Update documentation and various bug fixes.</li>
<li>Compiles under MSVC, avoiding the use of gcc-isms when not using gcc.</li>

<p>About:</p>
<p>LibLO is a lightweight library for handling the sending and receiving of messages according to the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol on POSIX systems.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<p>lo_server_get_protocol() and lo_address_get_protocol() were added. Tests for lo_address_get_* were added to the test tool. Several compiler warnings were fixed. The address for package bug reports was changed. lo_blob_new() was changed to take const void*. The getnameinfo() method of getting hostname is disabled when IPv6 is disabled. A Unix server socket is now unlinked when it is closed. The size of a Unix socket path is checked properly.</p>
